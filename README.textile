Squire2 is basically Squire rewritten from scratch for 4.0/Cataclysm. I felt the Squire code
became unsuitable to handle the several changes to mounts ; both mount features and API have
been slightly changed.

This is a work in progress. Most of core features are in but some bugs and glitches still need to be ironed out.

There is no much visible differences from Squire :
* Dos not dynamically update the macro anymore, do it on demand instead.
* Configuration is done from the "Mounts" tab of the spellbook.
* Use Ace3 for configuration UI.
* Accept items and macros, as well as spells, as combat action.
