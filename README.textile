Squire2 is basically Squire rewritten from scratch for 4.0/Cataclysm. I felt the Squire code became unsuitable to handle the several changes to mounts ; both mount features and API have been slightly changed.

h3. Features

* Can be used as a macro or with a keybinding.
* Automatically scan available mounts and movement-related spells (including Aspect of the Cheetah, Travel/Aquatic/Flight forms and Ghost Wolf).
* Random mount selection, trying not to use the same mount twice in a row.
* Handle some special mounts like Ahn'Quiraj ones, the Sea Turtle and the Abyssal Seahorse.
* Customizable moving and combat actions.
* Support "/console autoUnshift 0" and "/console autoDismount 0" settings, thanks to Phanx.

h3. How to use Squire2

You can open the Squire2 configuration using the /sq2 or /squire2 chat commands. There is also a button in the top left corner of the mount spellbook.

From there you can use the "Macro" button to pick up the macro and put it in any action button. You can also define a keybinding (including mouse buttons) to use Squire2.

The "Toggle spellbook" button just helps opening the Spellbook directly to the mount page.

h4. Mount selection

You can select which mounts Squire2 is allow to use using the Mounts spellbook. Squire2 adds a little checkbox in the bottom right corner of each mount icon. Uncheck it to have Squire2 ignore the mount.

h4. Other options

* Ground modifier: select a modifier to enforce Squire2 to select a ground mount even if flying mounts are usable.
* Dismount/exit vehicle/cancel shapeshift: if checked, Squire2 makes your character dismount when mounted instead of trying to use another mount.
* ... but not when flying: this prevents Squire2 from having your character dismount when flying. Useful to prevent an horrible death if you accidently hit the keybinding while in the middle of the sky. 
* Combat action: an action to be used in combat. This overrides the internal macro Squire2 uses and thus ignore all clever features.
* Moving action: an action to be used while moving. It is also used as a default combat action.

h3. Differences with Squire

There is no much visible differences from Squire :
* Does not dynamically update the macro anymore.
* Configuration is done from the "Mounts" tab of the spellbook.
* Use Ace3 for configuration UI.
* Accept items and macros, as well as spells, as moving and combat actions.
